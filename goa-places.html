               <b> Baga</b> is a famous beach destination in North Goa that attracts thousands of tourists and watersports lovers
                to its heart.  The beach shares its coastal line from the environs of Sinquerim, Candolim, and Baga, with the Baga 
                shore being more lively and enticing. This bubbly beach is one of the best in Goa that stays awake the whole night.
                 Called as "The Hometown of Nightlife," Baga beach is reputed for its cranky music celebrations by late-night, 
                 mouth-watering food, designer shops, and adventure sports.
  
                 Tourism in Goa’s coasts got ignited by 1960 after the famous summer gathering of hippies from San Francisco.
                  Baga beach then became popular among foreigners and slowly more exciting ventures like fishing, paddleboarding, 
                  discos, and tattoo shops started in the mainland. Named after “Baga Creek in Baga”, the tidal residuary channel 
                  that drains into the Arabian sea, Baga beach in Goa is also well organized with parking facilities and is maintained
                   tidy by the local governing authorities, besides experiencing hordes of travelers clubbing around.
        
                   Baga town is surrounded by the Baga river, and spotting the place where the river and the “sea meet, is a beautiful 
                   view to bait your eyes. Dolphins can also spotted deeper in the blue ocean and there are some spotting trips organized 
                   by local ship owners to spot the sea mammal.

        Goa is India’s favourite party place. Therefore, you simply have to visit one of the many clubs scattered around
         Goa on your visit there. Tito’s Street is one of the best clubs you can visit. Tito’s Street, named after the street
          it is located on, is a club that attracts a lot of crowd especially because of its prime location and its top-notch 
          service. Baga beach, where the club is located, is a party hub so it is no wonder that loads of tourists find their way
           to Tito’s Street after sundown.
        
            The club is known for its excellent services and this compensates amply for the slightly overpriced tags on drinks and 
            food. The place is made up of two levels: the lower level is a dance floor with a separate dance space for couples;
             the upper level allows people to sit and watch the activity below while enjoying their food and drinks. The DJ is reckoned 
             to be very good and you’re sure to get in some soul-pumping dancing on your visit.
        
            There are various entry vouchers which have complimentary services included. The vouchers begin from Rs. 1000/-. Their
             security is also among the best which is very important in a party-climate like Goa’s. It does not matter whether you go 
             during in or off-season. Tito’s Street is an exciting place to party in Goa all year round. Their cocktails are the talk
              of the town, so make sure you try them out. Nonetheless, even if you aren’t looking to drink, Tito’s Street is one of
               the places to visit in Goa for youngsters.

       <b>The Dudhsagar Waterfalls </b> are situated on the Goa-Karnataka border and are one of India’s must-see sights. The four-
            tiered waterfall structure is one of the tallest in India and is located on the Mandovi River. The white water cascades 
            down from a height of nearly 1017 feet off a nearly steep mountain face. They form a part of the Bhagwan Mahaveer
             Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, so the best way to reach them is by entering the national park and taking a van 
             allocated by the park to the falls.
              The Dudhsagar trek inside the park is closed to the public but you can still reach the waterfalls by trekking from Kulem and
               following the jeep trail. Another possible route is the trek from Castle Rock in Karnataka. Reaching the waterfalls will not
                be an easy task but it is one that is worth every ounce of effort put into it.  They are best experienced during the
                 monsoons as they lose their force during the dry season.

        <p><pre>This is one of the most frequented places for sightseeing in Goa. The lovely church which stands tall in the capital city 
            of Goa has had a long tryst with the past. It was first built as a chapel in 1541. Over this chapel, the larger building of the 
            church was then constructed in 1619. It has since undergone many revisions, but the original building has remained. It 
            draws devotees from all over the globe and has been a spiritual and geographical landmark for centuries.
        
            Old Portuguese sailors who crossed the perilous seas safely and landed at Goa would pay their first thanks at this church.
             Today, this church is a gorgeous white landmark in Panaji with a lovely multicoloured interior that at once imparts 
             peace and delight. It is at its best in December as the feast of Our lady of immaculate conception is celebrated on 
             8th of December followed by the Christmas and New year celebrations.

        <p>This is a little out of the way thing you can indulge in when in Goa. A Casino Cruise is essential, at the basic level, a restaurant, but with the additional casino features for those who want to try a hand at Vegas style entertainment. The ship is docked on one of the many rivers in Goa and is fitted with posh furnishings. The view outside and the rooms inside both make for a great set-up. The casinos are open all round the clock but they really come to life in the night from 9 pm to 3 pm. They are like clubs but instead of the DJ and the party music, you have casino games and low music. They are well-fitted spaces with fine dining options in place including a good selection of drinks.

It is an interesting off set to the beach scene and is only in operation from mid-November to April. The market first came into existence alongside the party scene at Anjuna beach in the eighties.
